<!--
  This is an example configuration file for computer online certificate requests.
  Applies to a User certificate to be enrolled via AutoEnrollment using the Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider (TPM-based) only.
  The certificate cannot be enrolled via MMC.exe or certreq (which some users could do to use a Software Key Storage Provider that makes the Key exportable).
  Note that both properties are based on request attributes that could be altered by the requestor with enough effort.
