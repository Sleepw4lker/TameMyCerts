# Logs generated by the TameMyCerts policy module {#logs}

In addition to the certification authorities regular log entries, the policy module will also write a detailed log entry if a certificate request was denied due to a policy violation or failure. Find the logs under the _Application_ event log with the `TameMyCerts` Event Source.

Logging for the policy module follows the `LogLevel` (<https://www.gradenegger.eu/en/configure-log-level-log-level-for-the-certification-authority-event-log/>) concept of the certification authority. Increasing the value for the certification authority also affects the logging amount of TameMyCerts.

```batch
certutil -setreg CA\Loglevel {LogLevel}
net stop certsvc
net start certsvc
```
