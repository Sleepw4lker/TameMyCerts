### Configuring

To **enable** a flag, enter the following commands into an elevated ("run as Administrator") command prompt (the example uses the TMC_DENY_IF_NO_POLICY flasg, adjust to your needs):

```
certutil -setreg Policy\TmcFlags +0x1
```

To **disable** a flag, enter the following commands into an elevated ("run as Administrator") command prompt (the example uses the TMC_DENY_IF_NO_POLICY flasg, adjust to your needs):

```
certutil -setreg Policy\TmcFlags -0x1
```

> As registry settings are applied on service startup, the certification authority service must be restarted for the settings to apply after a change.

```
net stop certsvc
net start certsvc
