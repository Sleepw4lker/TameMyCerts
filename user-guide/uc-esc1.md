### How TameMyCerts can reduce severity of attacks against the ESC1 attack vector {#uc-esc1}

Attacks on Microsoft certification authorities include the abuse of permissions on certificate templates. In many cases, certificate templates must be configured to allow the enrollee request any kind of identity, which can lead to account impersonation and elevation of privileges. These kinds of attacks are known as ESC1 (<https://posts.specterops.io/certified-pre-owned-d95910965cd2>) in the security scene.

ESC1 abuses a certificate template that is configured with the "Enrollee supplies subject" setting enabled (also called an "offline" certificate template, because the identity is provided by the enrollee, as opposed to an "online" certificate template where the certificate identity is built from Active Directory based on the enrollee's logon information). The adversary would have to submit a certificate request containing a "malicious" Subject Alternative Name certificate extension.

TameMyCerts can contain the damage done in such a case, and in even prevent the attack in many cases:

- TameMyCerts can [enforce identity types](#subject-rules) and thus ensure that only defined certificate fields are allowed to get issued.
- TameMyCerts can [apply syntax rules](#subject-rules) to certificate requests and thus ensure that certificates only get issued if the certificate content matched defined naming conventions.
- TameMyCerts can [map requested identities](#ds-mapping) back to the according object in Active Directory and apply rules bases on accont status, security group or organizational unit membership.

Rule violations [are being logged](#logs) and thus allow alerting on policy violations.
