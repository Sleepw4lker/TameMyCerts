## Upgrading from a previous version {#upgrading}

The process of upgrading from a previous version is the same as [installing the module](#installing). Simply proceed as you would install TameMyCerts for the first time.

Depending on the version you previously used, it may be necessary to adjust your policy configuration files. Refer to the [upgrade instructions](#upgrade-instructions) in the [Technical Reference](#tech-reference) section of the document.
