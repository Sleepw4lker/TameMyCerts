## Modifying the Subject Distinguished Name of issued certificates {#modify-subject-dn}

> Applies to **online** and **offline** certificate templates.

TamyMyCerts allows modifying the Subject Distinguished Name (DN) of a certificate before it gets issued. It is capable of retrieving properties from a mapped Active Directory object and put these values into the Subject DN of a certificate. The resulting value can be either an attribute of a mapped Active Directory object, a field of the originating certificate request, a static value, or a combination of all.

![Populating the Subject DN based on advanced rules with TameMyCerts](resources/subject-from-ad.png)

This is useful in the following scenarios:

- Certificates issued via Autoenrollment shall have another value as the "cn" Attribute for the _commonName_ field (which would be the only combination with the original Microsoft policy module).
- Issued certificates shall contain additional Relative Distinguished Names that have not been requested by the enrollee.
- Issued certificates shall contain identities in form of a specific syntax which goes beyond built-in capabilities.
- A value from one certificate field shall be transferred to another one before issuing the certificate.

### Configuring

You define a **OutboundSubject** directive containing **OutboundSubjectRule** rules.

The _OutboundSubjectRule_ directive can be configured as follows:

|Parameter|Mandatory|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Field|yes|The Relative Distinguished Name that shall be populated.|
|Value|yes|The value that shall be put into the configured certificate field. Can contain variables.|
|Mandatory|no|Specified if the configured value may be omitted if one of the variables is invalid or empty. If set to "true", requests will get denied in such a case. Defaults to **false**.|
|Force|no|Specifies how to act when the originating certificate request already contains a field of the specified type. If set to true and a field of same type is present, it **gets overwritten with the configured value**. If set to false, no action is made. Defaults to **false**.|

You may specify the following Relative Distinguished Names (RDN) for the "Field" directive:

|RDN|Maximum length|Typical AD attributes|Remarks|
|---|---|---|---|
|emailAddress|128|mail||
|commonName|64|name, sAMAccountName, displayName, userPrincipalName||
|organizationName|64|company||
|organizationalUnitName|64|department||
|localityName|128|l||
|stateOrProvinceName|128|st||
|countryName|2|c||
|title|64|title|not enabled by default|
|givenName|16|givenName|not enabled by default|
|initials|5|initials|not enabled by default|
|surname|40|sn|not enabled by default|
|streetAddress|30|streetAddress|not enabled by default|
|unstructuredName|1024|n/a||
|unstructuredAddress|1024|n/a||
|serialNumber|1024|n/a||

> The field names are processed _case-sensitive_.

The _Value_ may contain a static string, or can be combined with attributes of mapped Active Directory objects, or content from the certificate request.

> It is also possible to remove a requested relative distinguished name from an issued certificate by setting the _Value_ to an empty string.

You configure variables with the following syntax:

```
{Modifier:PropertyNameGoesHere}
```

The following modifiers are currently supported:

|Modifier|Description|
|---|---|
|ad|Attributes of mapped Active Directory objects. For a list of supported Active Directory attributes, consult the [DirectoryServicesAttribute](#ds-attribute) section within the [Technical Reference](#tech-reference) chapter of this document.|
|sdn|Fields from the Subject Distinguished Name of the certificate request.|
|san|Fields from the Subject Alternative Name of the certificate request.|

> Note that if you plan to insert attributes from mapped Active Directory objects, you need to configure [DirectoryServicesMapping](#ds-mapping).

### Remarks

- Configuring an invalid **Field** will lead to certificate requests getting denied.

- Configuring a **Value** that violates length constraints for the selected **Field** will lead to certificate requests getting denied.

- It is possible to remove a relative distinguished name by setting the **Value** to an empty string. A more advanced variant of this is to transfer a value from one requested RDN to another one and then remove the original one.

### Examples

Issued certificates will have a _commonName_ field which will contain the content of the _userPrincipalName_ Active Directoy attribute of the mapped object. Furthermore, the _emailAddress_ field will be populated with the content of the _mail_ AD attribute. Should the _userPrincipalName_ AD attribute not be populated in AD, the request will get denied. Should the _mail_ AD attribute not be populated in AD, the certificate will get issued but not include an _emailAddress_ field.

```xml
<DirectoryServicesMapping />
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>commonName</Field>
    <Value>{ad:userPrincipalName}</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>emailAddress</Field>
    <Value>{ad:mail}</Value>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

The _commonName_ will be built out of the two Active Directory attributes _sn_ (surname) and _givenName_. Assuming the given name is "John" and the surname is "Doe", the _commonName_ in the issued certificate will be "Doe, John".

```xml
<DirectoryServicesMapping />
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>commonName</Field>
    <Value>{ad:sn}, {ad:givenName}</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

The _commonName_ will be built out of the _name_ Active Directory attribute and a static string. Assuming the _name_ attribute contains "John Doe", the _commonName_ in the issued certificate will be "John Doe is an awesome fellow!".

```xml
<DirectoryServicesMapping />
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>commonName</Field>
    <Value>{ad:name} is an awesome fellow!</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

The _commonName_ will be built out of the _displayName_ Active Directory attribute. The _organizationName_ will be set to "TameMyCerts", regardless if the originating certificate request did contain this field or not.

```xml
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>commonName</Field>
    <Value>{ad:displayName}</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>organizationName</Field>
    <Value>TameMyCerts</Value>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

Transfering the **first** _dNSName_ of the Subject Alternative Name into the _commonName_ field of the issued certificate.

```xml
<!-- does not require DirectoryServicesMapping -->
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>commonName</Field>
    <Value>{san:dNSName}</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

The content of the _stateOrProvinceName_ field will be removed from the issueed certificate, if present in the certificate request.

```xml
<DirectoryServicesMapping />
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>stateOrProvinceName</Field>
    <Value></Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```

The content of the _stateOrProvinceName_ field will be transferred from the certificate request into the _serialNumber_ field of the issued certificate, and the _stateOrProvinceName_ field will be removed from the issued certificate.

```xml
<DirectoryServicesMapping />
<OutboundSubject>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>stateOrProvinceName</Field>
    <Value></Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
  <OutboundSubjectRule>
    <Field>serialNumber</Field>
    <Value>{sdn:stateOrProvinceName}</Value>
    <Mandatory>true</Mandatory>
    <Force>true</Force>
  </OutboundSubjectRule>
</OutboundSubject>
```
